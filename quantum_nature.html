            <h3> More data centers are being built each year, but they can disturb nearby communities by taking their electricity and water supply and making noise.

                A nature reserve can consist of a forest and trails!
                <br><br>
                Most data centers release greenhouse gases so by having a forest and improving the soil will make up for the emissions. 
                <br><br>
                The nature reserve will also give a place for people to walk through and enjoy.
